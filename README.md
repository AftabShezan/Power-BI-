Project: Adventure Works Sales Dashboard Analysis
This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard for Adventure Worksâ€™ sales data. As part of my learning and portfolio development, I tackled the entire data analysis pipeline, from data loading to final dashboard visualization.
Key Learnings & Steps:
1.	Data Loading & Extraction: Using Power BI, I learned to connect to various data sources and load large datasets efficiently. I used both Excel and SQL as sources for my data.
2.	Data Cleaning & Transformation: I performed data wrangling tasks like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring the accuracy of the data through Power Query.
3.	Data Modeling: I created relationships between different data tables and ensured that the data model was optimized for performance.
4.	DAX Writing: I wrote several DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as Total Orders, Profit, and Return Rates. I used advanced DAX functions for insights and predictions.
5.	Creating KPIs & Insights: By analyzing sales data, I created KPIs such as turnover by region, product growth rate, and customer analysis. I explored both high-level and granular insights like product return rates and sales trends over time.
6.	Visualization with Bar and Graphs: I used different visual elements like bar charts, line graphs, and maps to display insights in an easy-to-understand format.
7.	Dashboard Creation: The project culminated in a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides an interactive view of sales performance, customer analysis, and regional sales trends.
This project gave me the hands-on experience necessary to become proficient with Power BI. It helped me learn how to visualize large datasets and derive actionable insights.
